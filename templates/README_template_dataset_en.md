# Data and products of the "*dataset name "*.

With the help of the data steward or system manager, provide a few lines describing the data in brief (for NWEP systems, give the acronym). Important: The long description used here should be the same as the one used in the metadata: [source of descriptions](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/ec-msc/discovery-metadata/tree/master/mcf). 

> Example for the RDPS:

> The Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) performs physical calculations to produce deterministic forecasts of elements of the atmosphere from the present day to 84 hours in the future. Elements of the atmosphere include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and humidity. This product contains the raw numerical results of these calculations. Geographic coverage includes Canada and the United States. The horizontal spatial resolution of the data is 10 km. Data is available for 33 vertical levels. Forecasts are performed four times a day.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the [MSC Datamart](../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) data server services and [MSC GeoMet](../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) web services respectively: 

* Data *indicate format* available on the MSC Datamart [example](../msc-data/nwp_rdps/readme_rdps-datamart_en.md) 
* Link to the dataset subpage for GeoMet [example](../msc-geomet/giops_en.md), if the subpage exists

An [overview and examples for accessing and using Meteorological Service of Canada open data](../canada.ca_upcoming/usage-overview/readme_en.md) is available.
