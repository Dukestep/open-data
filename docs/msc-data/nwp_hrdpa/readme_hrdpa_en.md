# Data and Products of the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (CaPA-HRDPA)

The Canadian Precipitation Analysis System (CaPA) produces a best estimate of 6 and 24 hour precipitation amounts. This objective estimate integrates data from in situ precipitation gauge measurements, radar QPEs and a trial field generated by a numerical weather prediction system. CaPA produces four analyses of 6 hour amounts per day, valid at synoptic hours (00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC) and two 24 hour analyses valid at 06 and 12 UTC. A preliminary production is started 1 hour after valid time and a final one is launched 7 hours later. This translates into a production of 12 analyses per day. Actually, there are two deterministic configurations of the analysis, the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) and the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (HRDPA). CaPA-RDPA is connected to the RDPS for its trial field while CaPA-HRDPA is connected to the national HRDPS for its own trial field. For the configuration at 10 km, the domain is the same as the one for the RDPS and for the higher resolution configuration, it is the same as the the national HRDPS.
