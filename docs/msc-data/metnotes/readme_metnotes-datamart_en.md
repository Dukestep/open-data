# MetNotes data

This page describes the [MetNotes](readme_metnotes_en.md) data available in GeoJSON format via the MSC Datamart.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a GeoJSON file.

The MetNotes data are available at the following address:

[https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/{YYYYMMDD}/WXO-DD/metnotes](https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/)

where:

* __YYYYMMDD__: Year, month and day

A history of several weeks is kept in this directory.

## Filename nomenclature
