# Chronology of changes to the Global Deterministic Storm-surge Prediction System (GDSPS)

## Tuesday June 11, 2024

### Upgrade to Version 2.1.0 of Global Deterministic Storm-surge Prediction System (GDSPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 11, 2024, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Global Deterministic Storm-surge Prediction System (GDSPS) to v2.1.0

Significant changes:

*  The GDSPS v2.1.0 is driven by wind, atmospheric pressure, ice concentration, ice velocities, surface currents, salinity and ocean temperature profiles from the upgraded [Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)](../nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en.md) v9.0.0 and [Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS)](../nwp_giops/readme_giops_en.md) v3.5.0
* The bathymetry field has been updated to exclude isolated lakes
* The reference atmospheric pressure is now set to a constant value of 101000 Pa
