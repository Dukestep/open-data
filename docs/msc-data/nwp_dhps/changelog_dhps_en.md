# Chronology of changes to the Deterministic Hydrological Prediction System (DHPS)

## Tuesday June 11, 2024

### Upgrade to Version 3.5.0 of the Deterministic Hydrological Prediction System (DHPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 11, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Deterministic Hydrological Prediction System (DHPS) to version 3.5.0.

Significant changes:

* Expansion of the system's spatial coverage to include the Fraser River Basin in Western Canada
* Improvements in the quality control of assimilated streamflow observations and enhancements to the river routing model WATROUTE
* Dynamically Zoned Target Release (DZTR) model was removed for three reservoirs in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River domain
* A station in the Yukon domain was relocated for better accuracy

A brief summary of the innovations included in this upgrade and their impact on performance can be consulted in [this document](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/fact_sheets/factsheet_dhps-350_e.pdf). 

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available at [this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2024/06/10/NOCN03_CWAO_101857___46443).

## Wednesday June 21, 2023

### Upgrade to Version 3.4.0 of the Deterministic Hydrological Prediction System (DHPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

Significant changes :  

* Addition of 3 new watersheds (Columbia River, Skeena River, Bay of Fundy) and extension of the Yukon River watershed
* Implementation of the DZTR reservoir model on 18 new reservoirs for existing domains and on 11 reservoirs for new domains  
* Adjustment of deep reservoir status by assimilation of base flow estimated from total river flow observations  
* Relocation of some stations to improve accuracy 
* Changes related to evaporation losses
