# Chronology of changes to the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS)

## Tuesday June 11, 2024

### Upgrade to Version 3.3.0 of the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

Effective Tuesday June 11, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will update the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS) to v3.3.0.

Significant changes:

* Atmospheric forcing from a 10km component of the [Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)](../nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en.md)
* Upgrade to CICE6
* Usage of Delta Edington radiation scheme

A brief summary of the innovations included in this upgrade and their impact on performance can be consulted in [this document](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/fact_sheets/factsheet_wcps-330_e.pdf). 

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available at [this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2024/06/10/NOCN03_CWAO_101857___46443).

A technical note with more details on this system is available [at this link](http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_notes/technote_wcps-330_e.pdf).

The technical specifications document for WCPS 3.3.0 is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_WCPS_3.3.0_e.pdf) .



## Tuesday June 28, 2022

### Upgrade to Version 3.2.0 of the WCPS adapted to the New High Performance Computing Infrastructure.

See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md).

## Thursday February 24th, 2022

### Upgrade to Version 3.1.0 of the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

Effective Thursday, February 24th, 2022, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will update the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS) to v3.1.0.

The modifications to WCPS v3.1.0 compared with the previous operational version are as follows:

* For the pseudo-analysis/forecast components:
    * Ice loading over Great Lakes is correctly set up in the pseudo-analysis
    * River connectors between Lake Huron and Lake St-Claire have been revised to correct for some of unaccounted inter-lake flow
    * Regions of artificially enhanced mixing have been revised in order to better mix water in front of some lake outlets
    * Larger regions of data assimilation of bogus (zero) ice concentration have been set up to avoid numerical instability at lake outlet (which also relates to the embedded ice—and loading option) due to artificial ice pileups.
* For the river component:
    * No change

For more information, please consult the technical specifications document for WCPS v3.1.0 available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_WCPS_3.0.0_e.pdf).

## Wednesday December 1st, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 3.0.0 of the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

Effective Wednesday, December 1st, 2021, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will update the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS) to v3.0.0.

The modifications to WCPS v3.0.0 compared with the previous operational version are as follows:

* [RDPS v8.0.0](../nwp_rdps/changelog_rdps_en.md) replaces v7.1.0 as the pilot system
* New larger domain covering the Gulf of St. Lawrence (as well as the Great Lakes)
* For the pseudo-analysis/forecast components:
    * Increased resolution from 2km/5km (interior/coastlines) to 1km/2km
    * Ice loading over Great Lakes
    * Atmospheric pressure gradient forcing (inverse barometric effect for storm-surges)
* For the hydrological component: 
    * New observation stations of river discharge: Quebec, United States Geologicial Survey (USGS) 
    * Upstream propagation of information derived from observations of river discharge 
    * New climatological fields of drainage
    * Implementation of the Dynamically Zoned Target Release (DZTR) model to represent management rules of individual regulated reservoirs 
    * A new numerical solver in WATROUTE
