See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md).

## Wednesday December 1st, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 3.0.0 of the OPerational Hydrodynamic Simulation system (OPHS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

Effective Wednesday, December 1st, 2021, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will update the OPerational Hydrodynamic Simulation system (OPHS) to v3.0.0.

The modifications to OPHS v3.0.0 compared with the previous operational version are as follows:

* New harmonic boundary conditions
* Discharge is now from the Deterministic Hydrological Prediction System (DHPS))
   * Previously was from the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS) 
* Bias-correction of the discharge is removed
* Surface temperature now comes from the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS), rather than the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA-CaPA)

The official note announcing this implementation is available [at this location](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2021/11/26/NOCN03_CWAO_262118___50159).

## Monday May 13, 2013

### The Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) implements version 1.0.0 of the OPerational Hydrodynamic Simulation (OPHS) system

On Monday May 13 2013, CMC implemented the OPerational Hydrodynamic Simulation (OPHS) system in order to produce a daily analysis of the portion of the St-Lawrence river between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres. Please consult the OPHS page in the CMC product guide [here](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/product_guide/submenus/shop_e.html) for more information.
