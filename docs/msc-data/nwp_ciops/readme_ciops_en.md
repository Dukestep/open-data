# Data and products of the Coastal Ice Ocean Prediction System (CIOPS)

The Coastal Ice Ocean Predicton Systems (CIOPS) provide a 48 hour ocean and ice (CIOPS-E only) forecast four times a day at 1/36Â° resolution. A pseudo-analysis component is forced at the ocean boundaries by the Regional Ice Ocean Predicton System (RIOPS) forecasts and spectrally nudged to the RIOPS solution in the deep ocean. Fields from the pseudo-analysis are used to initialize the 00Z forecast, whilst the 06, 12 and 18Z forecasts use a restart files saved at hour 6 from the previous forecast. The atmospheric fluxes for both the pseudo-analysis and forecast components are provided by the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) blended both spatially and temporally with either the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS for CIOPS-East) or the Regional Deterministic Predicton System (RDPS for CIOPS-West) for areas not covered by the HRDPS.
