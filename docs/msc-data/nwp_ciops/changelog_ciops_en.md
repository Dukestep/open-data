# Chronology of changes to the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System (CIOPS)

## Tuesday June 11, 2024

### Upgrade of the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System East (CIOPS-East) and West (CIOPS-West) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 11, 2024, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System East (CIOPS-East) to version 2.3.0 and the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System West (CIOPS-West) to version 2.3.0. 

Significant changes in CIOPS-East:

* New region of the upper estuary increased mixing
* Updated St. Lawrence River temperature climatology
* Upgrade to CICE6
* Usage of delta Edington radiation scheme

A brief summary of the innovations included in this upgrade of CIOPS-East and their impact on performance can be consulted in [this document](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/fact_sheets/factsheet_ciops-e-230_east.pdf). 


Significant change in CIOPS-West:

* Atmospheric forcing from changes from RDPS to [GDPS](../nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en.md)
* Upgrade to CICE6
* Usage of delta Edington radiation scheme

## Wednesday December 1st, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 2.0.0 of the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System (CIOPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday December 1st, 2021, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System (CIOPS) East and West to version 2.0.0. Starting with this upgrade, experimental CIOPS East and CIOPS West will obtain operationnal status.

The major changes of CIOPS-East in this upgrade can be summarized as follow:

* Operationnal status
* Reduced bottom roughness
* Increased vertical resolution in the upper water column (75 to 100 levels)
* Reduced wave roughness parameter.
* New wave roughness formulation for wind stress 
* Increased diffusivity in upper St. Lawrence estuary (west of Tadoussac) (drag in estuary)

The major change of CIOPS-West in this upgrade is the addition of a subdomain over Salish Sea area at 500m resolution.
