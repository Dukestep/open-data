# Data and Products of the Regional Deterministic Air Quality Analysis 

The Regional Deterministic Air Quality Analysis (RDAQA) is an objective analysis of surface pollutants which combines numerical forecasts from the [Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS)](../nwp_raqdps/readme_raqdps_en.md) as well as from the [Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System-FireWork (RAQDPS-FW)](../nwp_raqdps-fw/readme_raqdps-fw_en.md) and hourly observational data from monitoring surface networks over North America. These include Canadian measurement networks operated by the provinces, territories, and some municipalities and those networks covering the continental United States under the umbrella of EPA’s national [AIRNow](https://www.airnowtech.org/index.cfm?page=login) program. The RDAQA, which provides the best possible description of current air quality conditions, is used to inform the public, meteorologists in Environment Canada’s regional forecast offices, Health Canada and others, on the distribution of air pollutants at the surface and on the quality of the model in the context of air quality forecasts.

Every hour an early product is issued, approximately one hour after the time of measurement and a late product is also generated about two hours after, which contains a more complete observation data set. Also, a Firework product.... -- A compléter --

The Regional Deterministic Air Quality Analysis (RDAQA) are essentially surface maps of air pollutants that are obtained by optimally combining observations with the [Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System-FireWork (RAQDPS-FW)](../nwp_raqdps-fw/readme_raqdps-fw_en.md) outputs. Because observations are close to the truth and model outputs provide a complete spatial and temporal coverage, their combination is thought to provide a more accurate and complete representation of the air quality.  These maps are called “analyses”.  There are many potential applications for air quality analyses. Over extended time periods, the analyses are useful to assess long-term effects of air quality on human health. They can also be used to monitor the air quality modeling error.  If three-dimensional analyses are produced, they can be used to initialize an air quality forecast model, a process known as data assimilation, which can improve air quality forecasts.
