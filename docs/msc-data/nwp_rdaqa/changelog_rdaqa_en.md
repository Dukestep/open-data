# Chronology of changes to the Regional Deterministic Air Quality Analysis (RDAQA)

## Tuesday June 11, 2024,

### Upgrade to Version 2.2.0 of the Regional Deterministic Air Quality Analysis (RDAQA) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 11, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Regional Deterministic Air Quality Analysis (RDAQA) to version 2.2.0.

Significant innovations in this upgrade:

* Pilot model update: from [Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS)](../nwp_raqdps/readme_raqdps_en.md)
 version 24 to version 25.
