# Data and products of the High Resolution Deterministic Land Surface Prediction System (HRDLPS)

_To be completed: description of the system at a high level (will go in the discovery metadata). Suggestion: use the technical note, do not use acronyms of systems whose data are not open (see: https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/readme_en/) and therefore unknown to users, indicate that it is an experimental system. Ex: https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/ec-msc/public-doc/-/blob/master/docs/msc-data/nwp_hrepa/readme_hrepa_en.md_
