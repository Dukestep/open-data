# Chronology of changes to the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis system (CaPA-RDPA)

## Tuesday June 11, 2024

### Upgrade to Version 6.0.0 of the Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 11, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) to v6.0.0.

Significant changes:

* Addition of 86 additional stations from partner network Saskatchewan Fire Weather Network (SKForestry) to improve analyses for this province.
* Assimilation of dual-polarized radar data for 32 Canadian S-band radars (DPQPE) and 65 US NEXRAD radars (DAA). Addition of 3 US radars.
* These changes lead to a significant improvement in skill scores for a majority of precipitation thresholds.

## Wednesday May 3, 2023

### RDPA update following the replacement of GOES-17 by GOES-18

Since January 4, 2023 at 18Z, the GOES-18 satellite has taken over from GOES-17 as the operational western satellite. Within the operational RDPA system, GOES satellite observations are used to perform some of the post-processing of radar precipitation estimates. In particular, GOES data are used to create a cloud mask to clean up the radar data.

Since the GOES-17 satellite disappeared on January 4, the RDPA system has relied on the NT field of the RDPS forecast model to build the cloud mask. This contingency solution allowed post-processing of the radar precipitation estimates, but with less reliability than with GOES data.

To further optimize the post-processing of the radar precipitation estimates, RDPA was updated on May 3, 2023 to assimilate GOES-18 data in addition to the already assimilated GOES-16 data.

## Tuesday June 28, 2022

### Upgrade to Version 5.3.0 of the RDPA adapted to the New High Performance Computing Infrastructure.

On Wednesday, December 1st, 2021, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will upgrade its Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis systems (CaPA-RDPA (10km)) to version 5.2.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows :

* [RDPS v8.0.0](../nwp_rdps/changelog_rdps_en.md) now provides the trial field instead of RDPS v7.1.0
* Addition of 14 Canadian S-band radars
* Assimilation of observations from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) network
* Updates to the static quality control masks for 8 radars

## Tuesday September 18, 2018

### Upgrade to version 4.5.0 of the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis System (CaPA-RDPA) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Tuesday, September 18, 2018, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will upgrade its Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis systems (CaPA-RDPA (10km)) to version 4.5.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows :

* The trial fields for these precipitaion analyses are generated from the new version of the system implemented on September 18, 2018:
    * CaPA-RDPA now builds its trial fields from [RDPS v6.0.0](../nwp_rdps/changelog_rdps_en.md)
* Assimilation of the observations from the CoCoRaHS network. (CaPA-RDPA)
* New 24h analysis valid at 06h00 UTC in line with the climatological day. (CaPA-RDPA)
* CaPA-RDPA v4.5.0 will be using the 0 and 6 hour lead times of the total precipitation field instead of the 6 and 12 hour. This is made possible because the RDPS v6.0.0 can now generate precipitation right from the beginning of the integration.

## Wednesday November 9, 2016

### Upgrade to the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis system (CaPA-RDPA) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Wednesday November 9th 2016, starting with the 1200 UTC run the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis System (CaPA-RDPA) by replacing CaPA-RDPA 3.2.0 by version 4.0.0. This new version assimilates precipitation observations provided by two networks of stations newly available at CMC. Pseudo-observations of 0 mm inferred from the American METAR network are added to the dataset submitted to CaPA system. Finally, 33 American weather radars are added to the composite of quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) which is also assimilated by the system. All these modifications allow producing a better precipitation analysis.

## Tuesday December 15, 2015

### Upgrade to the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA (CaPA)) version 3.2.0 at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Tuesday December 15th 2015, starting with the 1200 UTC run the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA (CaPA)) by  replacing CaPA-RDPA 3.1.0 by version 3.2.0. This version will solve two minor problems: The first of which is related to the processing of precipitation reports and the second which affects the GRIB2 encoding procedure by adding a mask to represent well the No-Data regions.
