# Hydrometric observations data

## Description of the system

Real-time and historical hydrometric data including stations, water levels and flow data for rivers and lakes across Canada.

## Access

### How to access the data

The data is available from the [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) API / web services and on the [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) data server:

* [Data available on the GeoMet-OGC-API geospatial web services](https://api.weather.gc.ca/):
    * [Hydrometric Monitoring Stations](https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-stations)
    * [Real-time Hydrometric Data](https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-realtime)
    * [Daily Mean of Water Level or Flow](https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-daily-mean)
    * [Monthly Mean of Water Level or Flow](https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-monthly-mean)
    * [Annual Maximum and Minimum Daily Water Level or Flow](https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-annual-statistics)
    * [Annual Maximum and Minimum Instantaneous Water Level or Flow](https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-annual-peaks)
