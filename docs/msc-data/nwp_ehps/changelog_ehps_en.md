On Tuesday June 11, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Ensemble Hydrological Prediction System (EHPS) to version 1.3.0.

Significant changes:

* Improvements in the quality control of assimilated streamflow observations and enhancements to the river routing model WATROUTE
* Dynamically Zoned Target Release (DZTR) model was removed for three reservoirs in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River domain
* A station in the Yukon domain was relocated for better accuracy
