# Historical observations data available on MSC GeoMet

GeoMet-OGC-API provides access to climate data (normals, daily, monthly, hourly, and stations). With this data, users can build mobile apps, create interactive web maps, and display and animate climate data layers in desktop software.

## Access to the geospatial web services

Historical observations data is available via [OGC-API Feature collections](../../msc-geomet/ogc_api_en.md#ogc-api-features) in GeoMet-OGC-API.

## Usage

The [usage overview page](../../usage/readme_en.md) provides generic information on using OGC services with desktop software, mobile apps, interactive web maps and direct access. Please refer to the [raw vector data accesstutorials](../../usage/tutorials_en.md#raw-vector-data-access) and [the OGC-API Features technical documentation](../../msc-geomet/ogc_api_en.md#ogc-api-features) for a detailed description of the API and data access examples via Python and QGIS.
