# Chronology of changes to the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS)

## Tuesday June 11, 2024

### Upgrade to Version 1.9.0 of the GDWPS.

On Tuesday June 11, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) to version 1.9.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows:

* Use of the latest version of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), version 9.0.0
* No significant improvement or degradation in significant wave height or peak period statistics

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available at [this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2024/06/11/NOCN03_CWAO_311455___xxxxx).

A technical note with more details on this system is available [at this link](http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_notes/technote_gdwps-190_e.pdf).

The technical specifications document for GDWPS 1.9.0 is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_GDWPS_1.9.0_e.pdf) .


## Tuesday June 28, 2022

### Upgrade to Version 1.8.0 of the GDWPS adapted to the New High Performance Computing Infrastructure.

See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md)

## Wednesday December 1st, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 1.7.0 of the GDWPS.

On Wednesday December 1st, 2021, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) to version 1.7.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows:

* Use of GDPS v8.0.0
* Parameterization optimised for GDPS v8.0.0
* Use WaveWatch III version 7 which have the same physics as v5.16 and includes negative peak period bugfix
* Activate Miche style limiter which offer to break unrealistically large waves in shallow water
* Use hourly wind input past 144h newly available with GDPS v8.0.0

## Wednesday November 1, 2017

### The Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) is declared operational at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

Effective November 1, 2017, after over two years running in experimental mode, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada declared operational the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS v1.3.0).

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available at [this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2017/10/31/NOCN03_CWAO_311455___01870).

## Tuesday June 23, 2015

### Experimental Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Tuesday, June 23 2015, the Canadian Meteorological Centre implemented a new experimental Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS). The development of the GDWPS was made through a partnership with NCEP/NOAA.
